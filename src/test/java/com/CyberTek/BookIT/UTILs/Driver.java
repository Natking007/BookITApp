    /*
    The TheadLocal construct allows us to store data that will be accessible only by a specific thread.

Let's say that we want to have an Integer value that will be bundled with the specific thread:

ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal<>();
Next, when we want to use this value from a thread we only need to call a get() or set() method.
Simply put, we can think that ThreadLocal stores data inside of a map â€“ with the thread as the key.

Due to that fact, when we call a get() method on the threadLocalValue, we will get an Integer value for the requesting thread:

threadLocalValue.set(1);
Integer result = threadLocalValue.get();
We can construct an instance of the ThreadLocal by using the withInitial() static method and passing a supplier to it:

ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);
To remove the value from the ThreadLocal, we can call the remove() method:

threadLocal.remove();
To see how to use the ThreadLocal properly, firstly, we will look at an example that does not use a ThreadLocal,
 then we will rewrite our example to leverage that construct.
